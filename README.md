# TS VAE-LSTM


> Implementation of the paper [Anomaly Detection for Time Series Using
> VAE-LSTM Hybrid Model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9053558)

This is a work in progress.

#### TODO

- [ ] Separate training from notebooks
- [ ] Fix github-actions
  - [ ] Page deployment
  - [ ] CI tests
  - [x] precommit
- [x] Build complete AD pipeline
- [x] include fine-grained threshold with quantile for within window
  detection.
- [x] use a squared term if the absolute element-wise error falls below
  delta and a delta-scaled L1 term otherwise (Huber)
- [x] Use dotenv `.env` to manage paths
- [ ] Plot has a shift of 21 due to remainder -\> todo

#### Installation

``` sh
pip install ts_vae_lstm
```

#### Results from NYC Traffic dataset

At time $t$, past $k$ window(s) of length $p=48$ are taken. The VAE-LSTM
reconstructs the past windows and if the true time series deviates from
the reconstructed time series, the $k^{th}$ window is marked as an
“anomalous window”.

VAE-LSTM is trained on a time series without anomalies so any deviation
beyond the 90th quantile of reconstruction error (L2 norm) is considered
an anomaly.

In the figure, blue lines represent the unseen data. Orange lines
correspond to the reconstructed data. Red dashed lines are the true
labels in the unseen set. Green window is the region where anomaly was
predicted. Green line is the first time anomaly was flagged in the
window.
